LUE is an acronym for "Life, the Universe and Everything". It is pronounced as the French pronounce the name
Louis (`LU-EE`).
:::

The LUE data model is described in more detail in {cite:p}`DeBakker:2017` and {cite:p}`DeJong:2019`. Details
about the LUE framework can be found in {cite:p}`DeJong:2021` and {cite:p}`DeJong:2022`.

LUE is the result of multiple research projects performed by the [Computational
Geography](https://www.computationalgeography.org) group at Utrecht University in The Netherlands. One of the
focus areas of this group is to improve on the concepts and design of environmental modelling frameworks, with
respect to their functionality and performance. The LUE software allows us to test our ideas. Our goal with
LUE is to keep the ideas that work well, and eventually turn the software into an environmental modelling
framework that is useful for domain experts.
